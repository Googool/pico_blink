# Library with *Blink* functions for the Pico <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="images\icon.svg">

A collection of *blink* functions for the Raspberry Pi Pico that allows you to control the onboard (or external) LED in various ways.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository currently serves no specific purpose other than to assist in testing submodules for another Raspberry Pi Pico [project](https://github.com/Googool/unknown). Future updates might include additional features and enhancements.

## Quickstart ðŸš€

Getting started with this library is straightforward. The only hardware needed is a Raspberry Pi Pico development board. Most Raspberry Pi Pico boards have an onboard LED, so no external diodes or resistors are needed to start blinking.

*Quickly show how to clone/build the library*.

The onboard LED of the Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to the GP25 pin, which supports Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM). This capability allows for more advanced functions beyond simple blinking, such as pulsing and other effects, which can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/Googool/pico_blink/tree/main/examples) directory.

*Add links to the top part of the "Quickstart" with a place you can buy/see the development board*.
