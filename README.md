## Quickstart ðŸš€

![Raspberry Pi Pico pinout](images/pico-pinout.png)

According to the pinout of the Raspberry Pi Pico, the onboard LED is connected to the GP25 pin, which is also capable of doing Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM). This library includes a **pulsing** function, which can be found inside of the [examples](https://github.com/Googool/pico_blink/tree/main/examples) folder.

## Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/Googool/pico_blink/tree/main/examples) folder for sample programs that demonstrates how to use this library.
